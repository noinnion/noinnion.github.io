title: Introducing gReader
---

gReader was developed in the time when Google Reader service was the standard for feed aggregators. After it closure lots of new and innovative RSS services have arisen to light. gReader has decided to support 2 of the most popular services on the market, **Feedly** and **The Old Reader**. Even with the changes the goal is still to deliver best possible reading experience. So what makes gReader so special in comparison to other RSS readers.

### Simple, Fast and Intuitive

Many of us have little time but we have to or want to consume a lot of information during the day. Our goal was to create a news reader with the best possible reading experience. Users can quickly read their news/feeds in a simple and intuitive user interface. Article pages can be reduced to the minimum of just the main contents, so that a reader could just concentrate on, well… reading! Consuming content at places without an internet connection is also possible using the great Offline Reading features. You can also let gReader read aloud your news for you, leaving your hands free for other tasks. These and many more features could help you to make reading your news faster.

### Feedly, The Old Reader, local RSS Reader

As mentioned above gReader supports 2 of the most popular services, Feedly and The Old Reader. Both are great feed aggregators and are similar to Google Reader. Using feed aggregators keeps your data up-to-date on multiple devices. gReader also offers a local aggregator, i.e. all data are saved on your device. The advantage of this service is that feed contents can be updated faster. There is no delay of feed updates in contrast to the online versions.

### Awesome Themes

gReader offers you many beautiful themes for reading your news. They are separated in Light (Default, Blue, Green) and Dark themes (Sepia, Dark, Black). The different themes don’t only have aesthetic but also functional aspects. Light themes can be used during the day especially when the sun is shining. However Dark themes are used mostly in the evening or night to relieve eyes.

One strength of gReader is the Offline Reading feature. Offline Reading allows you to read you news without having internet connection.
