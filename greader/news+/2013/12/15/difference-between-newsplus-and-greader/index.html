  <h1 class="post-title">Difference between News+ and gReader</h1>
  <span class="post-date">15 Dec 2013</span>
  <p>Many of you are wondering what's the difference between News+ and gReader. In this post we want to point out the differences. On the first view the user interface is very similar to gReader's user interface. That's true because News+ is built from gReader app. We are not trying to reinvent the wheel.  Looking into more detail there are many new features that you could find in News+.</p>
<!--more-->

<p><strong>Google News extension</strong></p>
<p>The idea of creating News+ app was actually before Google announcement about the closure of Google Reader. We wanted to create an app for <strong>Google News</strong>. There are not many good Google News app out there so we decided to develop an app that covers the most important features of Google News.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Multi-Language</strong>: Google News supports multi-language in the form of regions. You can get the most up-to-dated news for your language by selecting the specific region. In News+ just press the globe button in the actionbar. All regions but Japanese region are supported. Selecting a region will show you the corresponding topics.</li>
<li><strong>Related News</strong>: Want to read more about article topic, you can find related news at the end of each article content.</li>
<li><strong>Searching</strong>:<strong> </strong>The most important feature is searching for news containing special words. Do you want to track news for a certain topic? Press the search button in the actionbar and type in the query you want to search. News+ will create a search tag and show you all article relating to your query.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Less support effort with Extensions<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Extensions is the new way to integrate services into News+. Since Google has decided to shutdown Google Reader, lots of new and innovative RSS services have arisen to light. It is very difficult to support all of them in one app like gReader. The benefits of extensions are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Extensions are independent app which could be developed by everyone. They are <strong>maintained and published individually</strong>. If something related to the extension is wrong only the extension needs to be fixed. It does not affect News+ app.</li>
<li>With <strong>less support effort</strong> we can concentrate more on the development of News+ app.</li>
<li><strong>More services also less-known ones</strong> could be supported.</li>
<li>Not only feed services but also <strong>Read Later services</strong> (Pocket, Instapaper, Readability) or <strong>Webservices</strong> (Youtube, Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Livescore, ...) could be realized with News+ extensions. <strong>Website</strong> owners could also create a special extension for their websites.</li>
<li>The best thing is that you can use <strong>all services in one app</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>We encourage the News+ community to create extension, and have them published to everyone!</p>
<p><strong>Why not integrate all this in gReader?</strong></p>
<p>gReader was designed to use only with Google Reader. Since its closure we have moved to Feedly and The Old Reader. The transition was more or less painful.  In case of Feedly all gReader's functionalities could be realized with Feedly Cloud API. In case of The Old Reader not all functionalities could be implemented because of the lack api access. It seems that The Old Reader's implementation is not completed. We would face the same problem with the integration of other services.</p>
<p>Another aspect is the large user base of gReader. Changing gReader to News+ would lead to internal changes. All users are forced to login and sync again.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits of gReader</strong></p>
<p>If you are using Feedly and The Old Reader and  are happy with it so there is no need to change. gReader will be developed further. It will get updates and improvements in the future. There are other advantages why you should use gReader.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Better integration for Feedly</strong>: Feedly offers many useful features (topics, ranking, ...) that could be integrated into gReader.  The main advantage over News+ is that it only has to support 2 services. Developing new features is much easier than having support for a lot of services. We will try to improve the reading experience so that reading is much more fun.</li>
<li><strong>No limitation:</strong> Using extensions with external apps has some limitation. Transactions have to be sent between News+ and extensions. It makes synchronization faster on gReader.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>What should I use?</strong></p>
<p>Both News+ and gReader are great readers. Above we have listed the differences between both apps. We also outlined why there should be 2 different apps (even they look similar). It depends on you what features you like. Both apps have a free version which you can use with only some limitation. If you want more so you should go for Pro (gReader) or Premium (News+) .</p>
<p>We know that people will complain about the existence of 2 apps and are not satisfied to pay again.  We are working hard to improve the reading experience on both apps  and hope you understand our decision. Thank for your support.</p>
