<p>The plugins feature is not very stable on pages with Flash. It is recommended to turn it off on viewing article with flash. Open the article in browser instead. You can disable the plugins integration in Settings-&gt;Reading Preferences.</p>
<p>There is a bug in Android webview that causes memory leak. There is a workaround that unfortunately causes crashes on pages with combo boxes. To avoid the crash, don't use the combo boxes or load the page on the browser.</p>
