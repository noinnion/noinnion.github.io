<p>With the time of using the app it could become slower. There are several reasons for performance issues.</p>
<p>1. <strong>Increased number of articles in database</strong>: Try to keep your number of articles low. Having too many articles in the database could increase the query time. Set auto cleanup feature to automatically removing read items from database (Settings-&gt;Cache-&gt;Auto cleanup)</p>
<p>2. <strong>Slow SD-Card</strong>: Some SD-Card are not very fast. Try to replace it with a faster one.</p>
<p>Sometimes try to clear the cache manually (Menu-&gt;More-&gt;Clear Cache).</p>
