<p>Normally offline usage should fetch the correct content for offline reading. There are sites where it does not work as desired. Here are some workarounds which you can try to solve the issue.</p>
<p>All changes could be done for each feed individually (Long press on the feed and select Preference).</p>
<ul>
<li>Offline format: Try to change offline format to Normal page</li>
<li>User Agent: Try to change user agent to Desktop</li>
</ul>
