*Effective on January 1, 2015*

##### Terms
This document describes the terms of service that apply to all noinnion web sites and/or applications.

By accessing any web sites and/or the mobile applications run by noinnion, you are agreeing to be bound by these Terms and Conditions of Use, all applicable laws and regulations, and agree that you are responsible for compliance with any applicable local laws. If you do not agree with any of these terms, you are prohibited from using or accessing this site. The materials contained in this web site are protected by applicable copyright and trademark law.

##### Use License
Purchases of noinnion mobile applications on the Android platform (either through an initial payment, in-app purchases or other means) may be refundable for a short time period in accordance with the refund policy of the application store from which the purchase was made. Once this time period elapses, all purchases are 100% non-refundable. noinnnion is in no way responsible for handling these refunds.
Permission is granted to use the noinnnion' mobile application(s). This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license you may not:

* modify or copy the materials;
* use the materials for any commercial purpose, or for any public display (commercial or non-commercial);
* attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained on noinnnion' web site(s), or mobile application(s);
* remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials; or
* transfer the materials to another person or "mirror" the materials on any other server or in another application.

This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be terminated by noinnnion at any time. Upon terminating your viewing of these materials or upon the termination of this license, you must destroy any downloaded materials in your possession whether in electronic or printed format.

##### Disclaimer
noinnnion' application(s) are provided "as is". noinnnion makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties, including without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights. Further, noinnnion does not warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy, likely results, or reliability of the use of the materials in its applications(s) or otherwise relating to such materials or on any sites linked to this application. 

##### Limitations
In no event shall noinnnion or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption,) arising out of the use or inability to use the materials on noinnnion' application(s), even if noinnnion or a noinnnion authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you. 

##### Revisions and Errata
The materials appearing on noinnnion' web site(s) and application(s) could include technical, typographical, or photographic errors. noinnnion does not warrant that any of the materials on its web site are accurate, complete, or current. noinnnion may make changes to the materials contained on its web site at any time without notice. noinnnion does not, however, make any commitment to update the materials. 

##### Links
noinnnion has not reviewed all of the sites linked to via its mobile application(s) and is not responsible for the contents of any such linked site. The inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement by noinnnion of the site. Use of any such linked web site is at the user's own risk. 

##### 3rd Party Content
noinnnion applications may display content from 3rd party sources (including but not limited to text, images, audio and video). noinnnion is in no way responsible for the suitability, age-appropriateness or otherwise of any such content. Use of any such content is entirely at the user's own risk. 

##### Policy Modifications
noinnnion may revise these Terms and Conditions of Use and/or its Privacy Policy at any time without notice. By using this web site and/or any noinnnion products, you are agreeing to be bound by the then current version of the Terms and Conditions of Use and Privacy Policy. 

##### Governing Law
Any claim relating to noinnnion' web site(s) or application(s) shall be governed by the laws of Australia without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
