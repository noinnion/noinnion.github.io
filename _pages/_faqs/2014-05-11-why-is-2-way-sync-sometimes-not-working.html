<p>Read status of an article is not synchronized with the server immediately. Â The statuses is synchronized in a batch with the server. It needs much less requests and improves the performance of the app.</p>
<p>Read synchronization happens:</p>
<ol>
<li>Global sync for new items</li>
<li>After changing to a new source. e.g. if you read a feed and change to another feed</li>
</ol>
